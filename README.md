The ***"Agrippa"*** project uses a ***Block Theme*** for WordPress

### "Agrippa" Theme Development Step-By-Step:

1. :white_check_mark: Within your local WordPress installation, go to `... > app > public > wp-content > themes` and add a new empty folder named `agrippa` :open_file_folder:

2. :white_check_mark: add the 2 **required** files for a WordPress Block theme, all within `agrippa` theme folder: 
- `style.css` 
- `templates` folder :open_file_folder: and a file inside of it named `index.html` (this file represents the default/fallback template and it will allow WordPress to recognize it as a block theme)
